Sports is a rich subject area with many voices, opinions and commentary. Finding fact-driven content is harder than it should be. neuspo was started with a commitment to discovering objective, descriptive and real-time sports information.

Our mission is to build a site where you can track sporting events, news and insights, with clarity into how content is recommended.

neuspo strives to provide the following:

- Discovery of interesting sport events
- High quality in-game play-by-play data
- Objective team updates
- Insights and game predictions
